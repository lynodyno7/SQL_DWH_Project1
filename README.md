# SQL_DWH_Project1
Building a modern datawarehouse using SQL Server. It includes ETL process, data modeling, and analytics.
First data project that will be improved as I learn.
This projects show cases the fundamentals of SQL that I have learned among Data Architecture.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project involves:

1. Data Architecture: Designing a Modern Data Warehouse using medallion Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers.
2. ETL Pipelines: Extracting, Transforming, and Loading data from source systems to warehouse.
3. Data Modeling: Developing fact and dimension table optimized for analytical queries.
4. Analytics & Reporting: Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights.

1. Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV Files into SQL Server Database.
2. Silver Layer: This layer include data clean up, standarization, and normalization process to prepare data for analysis.
3. Gold Layer: Houses business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.
